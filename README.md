## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Adding Test File

Test does the following:

- Starts the app with MyApp.
- Checks that no todo items are present at the start.
- Simulates tapping the add button to bring up the add todo dialog.
- Enters a title for the new todo item and confirms by tapping the 'ADD' button.
- Verifies that the new todo item is displayed on the screen.

### Next Step : Run the Test
To run your test, use the following command in your terminal, while being in the root directory of your Flutter project:
```
flutter test test/todo_test.dart
```
This will execute the test you've just created. If everything is set up correctly, the test should pass, indicating that your app correctly adds a todo item when the process is simulated.
